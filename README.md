# Secure-Upload: Secured and Easy File Storing & Sharing
Similar to Google Drive, Dropbox and iCloud but here, you wouldn't need to open an account. Simply upload a file and choose whether to have the file passworded. Voila! You've got your sharable link.

## Usage:
- Visit the application website
- Choose a file to upload
- Input a password if you want to
- Grab the shareable link to the uploaded
- Share and others can download your files (directly or after inputting the right password) from anywhere

## Technologies:
- Node JS
- Express JS
- EJS
- Multer
- Bcrypt
- MongoDB & Mongoose

## Sidenotes:
- Your password are securely stored using the **bcrypt** hashing technology. This way, even with an access to the database, passwords are still safe and are known by you alone.
- I'd be glad to work on improving the project further. If interested, kindly create an issue or send an [email](farhansodiq360@gmail.com)
- Kindly create an issue as well if there's a noticed bug or problem. Thank you
